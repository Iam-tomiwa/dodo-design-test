### Recommendations for Improvement

To further enhance this project, consider the following recommendations:

1. Integrate Material-UI:

  - Add Material-UI (MUI) components for more optimized, accessible, and visually consistent user interfaces.

  - Replace some custom or Tailwind components with MUI equivalents for better performance and additional features.

2. Implement State Management:

  - Integrate a state management library like Redux or Zustand to handle complex state efficiently.

  - This will simplify data flow, especially for scalable applications.

3. Improve Testing Coverage:

  - Once features are explicit, we can integrate Vitest and Testing Library test suites to cover edge cases and improve overall code reliability.

  - Include snapshot testing for UI consistency.

4. Component Documentation:

  - Use a tool like Storybook to document and visualize UI components, making the project more developer-friendly.
